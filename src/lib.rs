//! Htmlize handles both encoding raw strings to be safely inserted in HTML, and
//! decoding HTML text with entities to get back a raw string. It closely
//! follows the [official WHATWG spec] for encoding and decoding text.
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use assert2::assert;
//! use htmlize::{escape_attribute, escape_text};
//! assert!(escape_attribute("ab & < > \" '") == "ab &amp; &lt; &gt; &quot; '");
//! assert!(escape_text("ab & < > \" '") == "ab &amp; &lt; &gt; \" '");
//! ```
//!
#![cfg_attr(
    any(feature = "unescape", feature = "unescape_fast"),
    doc = r#"
If you enable the `unescape` or `unescape_fast` feature:

```rust
# use assert2::assert;
assert!(htmlize::unescape("3 &times 4 &gt; 10") == "3 × 4 > 10");
```
"#
)]
//!
//! This only deals with HTML entities; it does not add or remove HTML tags.
//!
//! # Which `escape` function to use
//!
//! If the text goes in an attribute, use [`escape_attribute()`], otherwise, use
//! [`escape_text()`]. If you need bytes (`[u8]`) instead of a `String`, use the
//! `_bytes` version of the functions: [`escape_attribute_bytes()`] and
//! [`escape_text_bytes()`].
//!
//! |                         | `&` | `<` | `>` | `"` | `'` |
//! |-------------------------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
//! | [`escape_text()`]       |  ✓  |  ✓  |  ✓  |     |     |
//! | [`escape_attribute()`]  |  ✓  |  ✓  |  ✓  |  ✓  |     |
//! | [`escape_all_quotes()`] |  ✓  |  ✓  |  ✓  |  ✓  |  ✓  |
//!
//! You should almost never need [`escape_all_quotes()`], but it’s included
//! because sometimes it’s convenient to wrap attribute values in single quotes.
//!
//! # Which `unescape` function to use
//!
//! All `unescape` functions require the `unescape` or `unescape_fast` feature
//! to be enabled. See the [features](#features) section below for an
//! explanation of the trade-offs.
//!
//! [`unescape()`] is probably fine for most uses. To be strictly correct, you
//! should use [`unescape_attribute()`] for attribute values.
//!
//! [`unescape_in()`] handles either depending on the value of the `context`
//! parameter. See its documentation for a discussion of the differences between
//! expanding attribute values and general text.
//!
//! [`unescape_bytes_in()`] is just like [`unescape_in()`] except that it works
//! on `[u8]` rather than strings.
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! The `escape` functions are all available with no features enabled.
//!
//!   * `unescape_fast`: provide fast version of [`unescape()`]. This does _not_
//!     enable the `entities` feature automatically.
//!
//!     This takes perhaps 2 seconds longer to build than `unescape`, but the
//!     performance is significantly better in the worst cases. That said, the
//!     performance of of the `unescape` version is already pretty good, so I
//!     don’t recommend enabling this unless you really need it.
//!
//!   * `unescape`: provide normal version of [`unescape()`]. Enabling this will
//!     add a dependency on [hashify] and may slow builds by a few seconds.
//!
//!   * `entities`: build [`ENTITIES`] map. Enabling this will add a dependency
//!     on [phf] and may slow builds by a few seconds.
//!
//! ### Internal features
//!
//!   * `iai`: enable [iai] benchmarks. This should only be used when running
//!     benchmarks. See the [Benchmarks section in the README][benchmarks].
//!
//!   * `bench`: enable unescape benchmarks by making internal functions like
//!     `unescape_fast()` public. This must only be used when running
//!     benchmarks. It is required to run unescape benchmarks. See the
//!     [Benchmarks section in the README][benchmarks].
//!
//!   * `_unescape_either`: used internally to configure benchmarks. You should
//!     not specify this directly. It is automatically enabled when
//!     `unescape_fast` or `unescape` are enabled.
//!
//! # Minimum supported Rust version
//!
//! Currently the minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) is **1.74.1**. Future
//! increases in the MSRV will require a major version bump.
