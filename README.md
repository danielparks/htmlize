If you only need to escape text for embedding into HTML then installing is as
simple as running:

```sh
cargo add htmlize
```

If you want to unescape entities back into raw text, see [Unescaping entities
into text](#unescaping-entities-into-text) below.

## Escaping text into entities

The `escape` functions should cover most cases where you need to safely embed a
string in HTML. Generally, if the text goes in an attribute, use
[`escape_attribute()`], otherwise use [`escape_text()`].

|                         | `&` | `<` | `>` | `"` | `'` |
|-------------------------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| [`escape_text()`]       |  ✓  |  ✓  |  ✓  |     |     |
| [`escape_attribute()`]  |  ✓  |  ✓  |  ✓  |  ✓  |     |
| [`escape_all_quotes()`] |  ✓  |  ✓  |  ✓  |  ✓  |  ✓  |

You should almost never need [`escape_all_quotes()`], but it is included because
sometimes it’s convenient to wrap attribute values in single quotes.

### `escape_text(string) -> string` ([reference][`escape_text()`])

Escape a string so that it can be embedded in the main text. This does not
escape quotes at all.

### `escape_attribute(string) -> string` ([reference][`escape_attribute()`])

Escape a string so that it can be embedded in an attribute. Always use double
quotes around attributes.

### `escape_all_quotes(string) -> string` ([reference][`escape_all_quotes()`])

Escape both single and double quotes in a string along with other standard
characters. In general you should not need to use this.

## Unescaping entities into text

This requires the `unescape` or `unescape_fast` feature. (`unescape` builds
much faster, so unless you really need the very fastest unescape, use it.) To
configure it:

```sh
cargo add htmlize --features unescape
```

### `unescape(string) -> string` ([reference][`unescape()`])

This follows the [official WHATWG algorithm] for expanding entities in general.

Strictly speaking, this does not correctly handle text from the value of
attributes. It’s probably fine for most uses, but if you know that the input
string came from the value of an attribute, use [`unescape_attribute()`]
instead. See the [`unescape_in()` reference documentation][`unescape_in()`] for
more information.

### `unescape_attribute(string) -> string` ([reference][`unescape_attribute()`])

This follows the [official WHATWG algorithm] for expanding entities found in the
value of an attribute.

The only difference is in how this handles named entities without a trailing
semicolon. See the [`unescape_in()` reference documentation][`unescape_in()`]
for more information.

### `unescape_in(string, Htmlize::Context) -> string` ([reference][`unescape_in()`])

This follows the [official WHATWG algorithm] for expanding entities based on
the context where they are found. See the [reference
documentation][`unescape_in()`] for more information.

### `unescape_bytes_in([u8], Htmlize::Context) -> [u8]` ([reference][`unescape_bytes_in()`])

This is the same as [`unescape_in()`], except that it works on bytes rather than
strings. (Note that both functions actually take and return [`Cow`]s.)

## Features

The `escape` functions are all available with no features enabled.

  * `unescape_fast`: provide fast version of [`unescape()`]. This does _not_
    enable the `entities` feature automatically.

    This takes perhaps 30 seconds longer to build than `unescape`, but the
    performance is significantly better in the worst cases. That said, the
    performance of of the `unescape` version is already pretty good, so I don’t
    recommend enabling this unless you really need it.

  * `unescape`: provide normal version of `unescape()`. This will
    automatically enable the `entities` feature.

  * `entities`: build `ENTITIES` map. Enabling this will add a dependency
    on [phf] and may slow builds by a few seconds.

All other features are internal and should not be used when specifying a
dependency. See the [reference documentation][features].

## Benchmarks

This has two suites of benchmarks. One is a typical multi-run benchmark using
[criterion]. These can be run with `cargo bench` or [`cargo criterion`] if you
have it installed.

To run benchmarks on the unescape functions, enable features `bench` and
`unescape` or `unescape_fast` (or both).

**Note:** The internal `bench` feature is required to expose internal functions
like `unescape_fast()` and `unescape_slow()` to the benchmarks. You must not
enable this feature when specifying a dependency, since its behavior is not
guaranteed to stay the same from point release to point release.

### iai benchmarks

The other suite of benchmarks uses [iai] to count instructions, cache accesses,
and to estimate cycles. It requires the internal `iai` feature to be enabled,
and only really works well on Linux.

To run iai benchmarks locally:

```sh
cargo bench --features iai iai
```

You may want to use `--all-features` or `--features iai,bench,unescape` or
`--features iai,bench,unescape_fast` to enable benchmarks of the `unescape()`
functions.

To run in a Docker container, use the `docker.sh` script. It will build an image
if necessary, then use that image for all future runs:

```sh
./docker.sh cargo bench --features iai iai
```

You can also start it in interactive mode and run the benchmark multiple times:

```
❯ ./docker.sh
root@d0a0db46770d:/work# cargo bench --features iai iai
   Compiling htmlize [...]
```
